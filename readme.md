### Welcome!!! 
----
Hello everyone, I'm Gabriel! I'm a biologist from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, and Master of Science from the Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program. 

I arrived in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ in August 2020 and embarked on a journey to become a skillful scientist and member of the academic ecosphere of Vancouver. I bring collegiality, creativity, and a strong work ethic to my research and teaching. I am passionate about the intersection of science and education, and I strive to make a positive impact in both fields. 

- I am particularly interested in evolutionary biology and its interface with genomics and population genetics (not so much mathematically, but macro and microevolutionarily). 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Ctenophores!!! They are my favourite branch of the tree of life, and working with their genomics for four years was mostly englithening and humbling when it comes to looking at life.

                 - Philosophy of Science & Education!

                 - Creating bots for videogames.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning applications of evolutionary theory through cancer genomics; python project structure and management, including src/ layout & userless dependency management.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently tinkering with an AI-generated python, windows-based gene browser guided mainly by Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
