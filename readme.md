### Welcome!!! 
----
Hello everyone, I'm Gabriel! I'm a biologist from Brazil 🇧🇷, and Master of Science from the Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program. 

I arrived in Canada 🇨🇦 in August 2020 and embarked on a journey to become a skillful scientist and member of the academic ecosphere of Vancouver. I bring collegiality, creativity, and a strong work ethic to my research and teaching. I am passionate about the intersection of science and education, and I strive to make a positive impact in both fields. 

- I am particularly interested in evolutionary biology and its interface with genomics and population genetics (not so much mathematically, but macro and microevolutionarily). 

- 💬 Ask me about: Ctenophores!!!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating bots for videogames.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning applications of evolutionary theory through cancer genomics; python project structure and management, including src/ layout & userless dependency management.
